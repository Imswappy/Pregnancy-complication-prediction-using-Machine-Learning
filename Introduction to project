Pregnancy complications are one of the leading causes of fatality and diseases in new born babies and their parent. If these things are predicted correctly at a very nascent level ,they can lead to prevention of problems in various stages of pregnancy. These stages can include from beginning stage , middle stage , delivery stage etc. Correct medications based on the accurate predictions based on several factors can enhance the quality of delivery and the new born child. Each individual varies from one another based on various factors. These factors can prove to be essential in detection of any complication if correct set of dataset , visualization , machine learning models are used.
This project aims to accurately predict complications in pregnancy based on various parameters like blood sugar, blood pressure , heart rate and age. First a sample dataset of over 1000+ cases was taken and from there the data is first visualized in order to draw several summaries , overviews and trends of complications based on these factors. The dataset is then pre processed in several methods like cleaning , featuring , handling , featuring and encoding in order to make it more accurate for machine learning models. The machine learning models are then one by one tested in order to find out which one predicts the complications more precisely. Then the accurate models are trained more using another dataset of about 10000+ data and then again tested. The final model that works best and predicts most accurately is then selected and deployed in order to finally predict the complications in real life cases.
