Use matplotlib to create visualizations that help you understand the dataset and gain insights into potential relationships between variables. For example, you can create scatter plots, histograms, box plots, or bar plots to visualize the distribution, relationships, or trends in the data. This will assist you in identifying patterns and potential factors associated with pregnancy complications.
